   The project manager or team lead assigns the bug to a developer responsible for fixing it. The assignment ensures accountability and tracks ownership.

   Once the developer believes the bug is fixed, it is marked as resolved. Details of the fix and any changes are documented.

5. **Verified / Tested**  
   The QA team verifies the fix to ensure the bug is solved and that no new issues were introduced. If the fix works, it moves to the next stage.
